							<p>Arachnid is powered by ZeroTier, an Open Source solution for creating secure and private intranets. This code has been modified and added to so it can be utilized as a large-scale Software-Defined Networking solution, to allow ease of access. On top of this, Arachnid doesn't collect (or need to collect) data for analytics as all testing is done in house.</p>
							<p>Arachnid serves not only as a secure medium to implement web-based services, but also as a way to extend the lifetime of IPv4. With the IPv4 address space quickly filling, people are quickly snatching up IP addresses as quickly as they can grab them. Our solution is to provide intranets, essentially networks in networks, where people can get get their traffic routed and obtain IP address space for their projects.</p>
