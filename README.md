# Arachnid Website

*What's here?*
This is the main site for Arachnid Networks (so far!). This is just a first draft for Arachnid's public facing page, containing several techniques to make it a fully responsive html5 page with parallax scrolling. </br>

The page works across all popular browsers, and contains all the public info in regards to the network.
